Ran into an issue after spinning up resources via Terraform using the template/boilerplate from the Microsoft Documentation.

Wasn't able to connect to my virtual machine using the key generated in Terraform, even after applying permissions etc.
I'm not going to lose sleep over it because I don't need Terraform to manage these keys.

So instead, create the keys ahead of time:

ssh-keygen -b 4096

then, set permissions:

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/*

terraform apply --auto-update
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa azureuser@<ip address>

admin_ssh_key {
    username   = "azureuser"
    public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
  }
