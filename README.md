# terraform-ssh-vm-lab

This is my lab documentation for using Terraform to provision new resources in Azure, and then connecting to the virtual machine with a new SSH key.

Next steps
- script to generate the key and run terraform
- add Ansible to automate the configuration of the virtual machine.
